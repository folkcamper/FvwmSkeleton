# libre office is distributed as a compressed rpm file. However we can get around 
# that. It goes something like this: 

Download the rpm 
tar -xvf libreoffice* 
cd Libre??/RPM
ls > extractall.bat 
chmod 755 extractall.bat
vi extractall.bat
%s/^/rpmextract / 
chmod 755 ./extractall.bat
./extractall.bat
mv libreoffice?.? /Skel/bin
mv program /Skel/bin/libreoffice?.?
