FvwmSkeleton: Fvwm,Bash,Vim configuration for diskless (and non diskless) multiuser 
office environments. 

VERSION 0.1

Summary: 

FvwmSkeleton is a compendium of common hacks used to create a fast multiuser installation for 
Fvwm. It is oriented towards data centric users, which is to say that it is designed to be 
fast for sysadmins, network admins, programmers, analysts, accountants. FvwmSkeleton does 
include a great number of scripts for integrating the most popular desktop applications, 
like: 

LibreOffice 
Blender 
ffmpeg 
mplayer 

This list will grow as FvwmSkeleton matures.  

There will be no games or browsers added to FvwmSkeleton. And considering the poor security 
histories of pretty much every popular browser (whether by actual insecurity, or by direct 
intrusion by their respective vendors) FvwmSkeleon does not install configurations for a 
browser by default. The included scripts are easy enough to modify for that purpose. 
However none are expected to be included in the base distribution. This is considered 
a feature.   

FvwmSkeleton is intended to be an adjunct tool for managing Linux installations in 
diskless or thin client environments. This does not mean that is bad for using on the 
desktop.  (it is in fact quite nice) It means that file layout is more monolithic  
than in typical Linux systems.  

FvwmSkeleton installs in: /Skel

/Skel is intended to provide a monolithic work environment, meaning that windows manager
and primary office utilities should install to /Skel, and provide for a common base 
of utilities for a an office, as well as a number of practical tools for IT adminstrators
in a variety of disciplines.
